#Camera frame timestamp source according to CameraCharacteristics.SENSOR_INFO_TIMESTAMP_SOURCE is SENSOR_INFO_TIMESTAMP_SOURCE_REALTIME.
#If SENSOR_INFO_TIMESTAMP_SOURCE is SENSOR_INFO_TIMESTAMP_SOURCE_REALTIME, then camera frame timestamps of the attribute CaptureResult.SENSOR_TIMESTAMP
#and IMU reading timestamps of the field SensorEvent.timestamp are on the same timebase CLOCK_BOOTTIME which is used by elapsedRealtimeNanos().
#In this case, no offline sync is necessary.
#Otherwise, the camera frame timestamp is assumed to be on the timebase of CLOCK_MONOTONIC which is generally used by nanoTime().
#In this case, offline sync is usually necessary unless the difference is really small, e.g., <1000 nanoseconds.
#To help sync camera frames to the IMU offline, the timestamps according to the two time basis at the start and end of a recording session are recorded.
